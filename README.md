**Standard Euclidean Algorithm PYTHON application for the TI-84 PLUS CE PYTHON edition calculator**

• This is a simple implementation of the Euclidean Algorithm to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers.
• The program takes two integers as input and calculates the GCD using the Euclidean Algorithm.
• It also displays the steps involved in the calculation of the GCD.
• The main function takes user input for the two integers and calls the euclidean_algorithm function to display the results.
• The program can be run and tested with different input values to verify the correctness of the Euclidean Algorithm.
• The Euclidean Algorithm is an efficient method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.
• The algorithm works by repeatedly applying the division algorithm to find the remainder of the division of two integers.
• The GCD is the last non-zero remainder obtained in the process.
